## CondationCMS – Module & Extension Exception (Developer FAQ)

In short:

You may develop modules and extensions for CondationCMS under any license, including proprietary or commercial licenses.

The only requirement: your module or extension must interact exclusively through the official Module/Extension API.

You cannot copy or modify CondationCMS core code if you want your module/extension to remain proprietary.

Modules and extensions must be installable and removable without altering core files.

Any modifications to the core itself remain under the GPL.

Examples:

A module adding new widgets → can be closed-source or commercial.

An extension visualizing CMS data → can be sold commercially.

Modifying core classes (CoreEngine, AdminUI) → GPL applies, even if a module is built alongside.

Developer shortcut:

“Anything that runs through the API can use your license. Anything touching the core stays GPL.”
